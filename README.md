# Incremental-load-pipeline
In this Incremental Load Pipeline involves creating a data pipeline that efficiently updates a target database by loading only the new or modified data from a source system, rather than reloading the entire dataset. The key idea is to minimize the data transfer and processing time by focusing only on changes since the last load.
